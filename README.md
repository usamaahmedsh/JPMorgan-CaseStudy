# Project Overview

This project addresses a business problem for Walmart:

   1. Binary Classification Model – Predict whether an individual earns more or less than $50,000 using demographic and employment-related variables.

   2. Segmentation Model – Divide the population into meaningful marketing segments and provide actionable recommendations.

The dataset used is weighted U.S. Census data from the 1994–1995 Current Population Survey, containing ~200,000 observations and 40 variables.
