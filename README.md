# Project Overview

This project addresses a business problem for Walmart:

   1. Binary Classification Model – Predict whether an individual earns more or less than $50,000 using demographic and employment-related variables.

   2. Segmentation Model – Divide the population into meaningful marketing segments and provide actionable recommendations.

The dataset used is weighted U.S. Census data from the 1994–1995 Current Population Survey, containing ~200,000 observations and 40 variables.

# Requirements 

You will need to set up an appropriate coding environment.

* [Python (version 3.8 or higher)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To install the libraries required for this assignment run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# How to Run

Open the notebook:

    notebooks/main(Q1+Q2).ipynb


Run all cells in order.

This notebook contains the classification model and the segmentation model

# The notebook covers:

 1. Data cleaning and preprocessing

 2. Feature engineering

 3. XGBoost model training and evaluation

 4. SHAP analysis for feature importance

 5. Rule-based segmentation and K-Means validation

 6. Marketing recommendations for each segment

_Note: Visualizations and code are provided in the accompanying Jupyter notebook, including SHAP analysis and cluster validation plots. Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook for all visualizations._
